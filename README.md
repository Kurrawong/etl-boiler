# ETL Boiler

Boilerplate patterns and utility functions for the conversion of tabular data to RDF
format.

The aim is that all you need to change is the `main.py` file, to update the simple
column mappings and add calls to any of the standard patterns.

The code starts with an example showing how some of the functions can be applied.
